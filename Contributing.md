# Contributing

You are welcome to contribute to the project. We use Grunt for building the website and will be using Jest for testing soon. As always tests and documentations are the weakest parts, but also some examples would be welcome in the folder `examples` and any idea you have to improve server is welcome through the public issue tracker.

> I am comfortable depending on `express` for the time being, so please do not create any issue or PR trying to remove it.


## Security issues

Please do not open any vulnerability issue on Github's issue tracker. Send me an email (find my personal email in [my website](http://francisco.io/)) if you find a particular issue within server, or contact privately the package author in case it's a sub-package issue.

I do not have a PGP-based email right now, but if requested I'll make sure to find out how to use it and publish it in github AND [twitter](http://twitter.com/fpresencia); for obvious reasons if you ask me for my PGP key through a private message don't trust that I answer through the same private channel or double-check with one of those public channels.
